## Password Generator 

## Description

I made this password generator for the University of Richmond Bootcamp Homework #3. I utilized HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 4 and Javascript to code this page, and used Github pages to deploy the final application. This application can be used to generate a random password between 8 and 128 characters.  The user can choose how they want to construct their password.  They have the choice of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numeric characters, and special characters to construct the password. The password is then randomly generated when the generate button is clicked.  They can also save the generated password to their clipboard, by pressing the copy to clipboard button.  

As a someone who cares about security, I need a secure password, so that I can keep my personal information safe.
